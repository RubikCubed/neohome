My name is Fernando Ayats and I am a student finishing my master's degree in Computing Research. I finished my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering in the Navigation System's specialisation, with my thesis consiting in programming a flight simulator and integrating it with HIL systems at Aurea Avionics.

In this webpage you can find blog posts about diverse topics, mainly about operating systems. It is run by Next.js 13, a javascript framework for React that leverages UI components to build websites with a mix of SSG and SSR. Used the [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/) template as a starting point.
