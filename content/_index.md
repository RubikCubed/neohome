My name is Fernando Ayats and I am a student finishing my master's degree in Computing Research. I finished my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering in the Navigation System's specialisation, with my thesis consiting in programming a flight simulator and integrating it with HIL systems at Aurea Avionics.
